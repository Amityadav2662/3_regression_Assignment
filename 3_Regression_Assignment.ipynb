    "Ridge Regression:\n",

    "1. Linear relationship: The relationship between features and the target variable should be roughly linear.\n",
    "2. Independent errors: Errors for each data point shouldn't be related to each other.\n",

    "key techniques to help you choose the best lambda:\n",
    "1. Cross-validation: This is the most common and reliable approach. Divide our data into folds, train a \n",

    "performance on the entire training set. Choose the lambda with the best performance metric. Grid search\n",
    "can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",
    "3. Randomized search: Similar to grid search, but instead of trying all possible lambda values, it randomly\n",
